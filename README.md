Hello!

This is how I handle learning new things. I am a learn by example kind of person so this will be where I test all my skills, more 
details below!

I'm using this Repository to learn GIT and how it works as well as brush up on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery.
I will use this platform to document my progress, take notes, create my porfolio, and keep my resume.
